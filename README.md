# Nifi Hello World Example
Apache Nifi is a Data Flow tool that allows for datat to be pulled or put into Nifi from many different endpoints.  Once the data is inside of Nifi it can then route data based on payload, enrich data, amongst do many other things before landing this data into another data repository (such as Hbase, Solr, HDFS, RDBMs, etc).  There are over 180+ different processors built inside Nifi and the hopes is to show you in this tutorial how to use Nifi as a WebServer and WebSocket to stream data and write data down to a flat file.  The intention of this tutorial is to provide a basic understanding of flexibility, ease of use this open source tool provides.
